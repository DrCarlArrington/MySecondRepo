We change the value in a cell using VBA with the .Value property

Specifically, use the Cells() or Range() function in VBA along with the value
property to change the value of a cell in a work sheet

Cells() uses numerical references for the row and column

	Cells(1,1).Value - references the first row and column in sheet

With Cells(), to access / modify a range of values, you have to put the values
in a loop. Otherwise, you have to reference each cell one by one in the range.

	Ex:
	Cells(1, 1).Value = 1
	Cells(1, 2).Value = 2
	Cells(1, 3).Value = 3

Range() uses the letter for column along with a number for the row

	Range("A1").Value - references the first row and column in a sheet

With Range(), to access / modify a range of values, you can use the : reference
to denote the start and end of the range

	Range("A1:C1") = 1
